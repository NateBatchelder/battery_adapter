3d printed battery connections with a common design language and form factor.

Disclaimer:

LiPo batteries are inherently dangerous.  Power tools are inherently dangerous.  Follow all manufacturer advice and your own common sense at all times.  The materials herin are in no way to be taken as fully vetted for safety and should be considered at all times to be works in progress.

Statement of Purpose:
Makers should have the ability to power their tools with devise agnostic powerpacks that are user regulated to match the power requirements needed.  Batteries shall be interchangable, servicable, and robust in construction and capacity.

Context:
Makers are forced to choose ecosystems of power tools in order to maintain expensive propriatary batteries.  Many, if not all, of these batteries use 18650 cells and standard circuitry to regulate current.  While some companies have chips on tools to handshake with powerpacks, this is often not the norm.  End users should be free to power their tools of choice without being tied into a singular tool ecosystem.

Goals:

Batteries should be accessable and servicable by the user.

Battery compartments should attach without screws.  Threaded inserts and imbeded hex nuts equally acceptable and the design should accomidate both.

Screws should not be countersunk (82*) but shall be recessed.

Battery compartments should host features essential to their safe use and storage.

Known incompatabilities should be documented as well as best pratices. 

Whenever possible, OEM parts should be included as well as suitable 3D printed replacements.  Designs will preserve the ability to use OEM contacts, but should foremost be fully printable by the maker.  Thus, space for the OEM contacts should take prioriety in the design process. 

Nomenclature: Herin, the convention of battery(B) to tool(T) shall be used.  As a best pratice, the letter 'b' will follow the brand of battery, and the letter 't' will follow the brand of tool.

Well stylized.  Battery is too far forward.
